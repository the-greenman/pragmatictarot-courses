    "content":"The Fool 
 
The fool is the first step. A leap into the unknown. Taking action without any awareness of consequences.  
 
Like a chicken emerging from it's egg, the fool acts without any idea of what lies in store, without any ability to plan or to anticipate.  
 
The fool has no fear. The fool is simply open to opportunity, able to step off the cliff and just  assume that things will be fine.   
 
The fool allows us to begin. Perhaps with most things in life, if we knew what was actually in store for us, we'd never actually start anything.  
 
 
To find the fool:  
 
Look for new beginnings 
Look for where you feel unbounded, free and light 
Look for actions where there is no thought for consequences, simply the desire to do something. 
 
Where are things stuck, unable to move on, because there are too many unknowns?  
Where are the potential consequences leaving you heavy and uncertain? 
Where could you just let go and take a leap of faith?  
 
The Tarot tells the story of the fool's journey. It is both the starting ignorance and the freedom of enlightenment. It could be that the Tarot is just trying to teach us to be better fools."

    "content":"This Telegram phase of the course has been designed to keep the cards on your mind. Every morning, I’ll share the card of the day and a little write-up.  Your task will be to observe yourself and your world, to see how you can find different aspects of each card reflected in your day. 

Telegram will give us the opportunity to share your experience. Use this channel to post text, photos and links that you find align with our card. Don’t worry about being “right or wrong”, you’ll get a feel for it as we go. 

Some people may want to jump right in sharing and communicating, but others may just want to observe, both are fine. Sometimes this process can get very busy, and if it gets a bit too much, mute your notifications and dip in when it suits you.

    "content":"The Magician

Things are always easier when you have fresh eyes. The Magician embodies the "magic" of beginner's luck. The Magician can walk into a situation, and, without any awareness or  knowledge of the details and the backstory, simply cut through all the crap and get things done.  
 
The magician has a childlike clarity of will. He's just pure will perhaps, without any encumbering baggage. The magician can see the end goal and move in a straight line to achieve it.  
 
Most of us can think of a situation  where we've been plugging away trying to solve a problem for ages, when someone else can just walk in and do it without thinking.  
 
That's the magician. It's not really conscious skill, the magic is often little more than sleight of hand, because it only deals with the surface, but often that is enough.  
 
To find the magician:  
 
Look for your ability to just make things happen, to act with a clear end goal.  
Look for environments where you can see simply solutions that everyone else overlooks 
Watch how you can sometimes get to your destination, but have no recollection of how you got there.  
 
Where do you find yourself constantly failing to get the results you got the first time? 
Where are you not really understanding why people are thinking or acting the way they are? 
Where are you getting tripped up by details you didn't see.  
 
The Magician is a young boy who sees the world in black and white, in simple shapes with clear and obvious ways to succeed."

He achieves his goals because he simply isn't aware that anyone else might have a desire that was different."

    "content":"The High Priestess 
 
The beautiful, mystical potential  of complexity. The interconnections between everything. The amazing hidden depths of life and living.  
 
The high Priestess sits calmly between the pillars of conscious and subconscious. She can perceive the inner and outer worlds. She can see through the simple veil and out into the deep, lifegiving sea behind.  
 
She is the bubbling, youthful female energy, seeking and inspired by beauty, love, life and relationships. She does not want to dell on the surface, she dives into the passion and complexity of life.  
 
The High Priestess is not really all that interested in the goal, instead she wants to experience every moment of the journey.  
 
To see the High Priestess:  
 
Find your excitement for learning new things? 
Watch for times when you're simply open to what is present and not seeking to change anything 
Look for the places where you are needing to go deeper, to understand subtlety 
 
Where do things feel too complex to understand? 
Where do you find your knowledge of just how complex and interconnected things are leaves you feeling helpless? 
Where do you feel overwhelmed by just how much there is to process? 
 
The high priestess is an expression of abundance. She can see the potential in everything. She flows with the changes all around her."

    "content":"There are many patterns to watch for in the cards. The swing from Yang to Yin, from expressive to receptive, is the most basic.

You can think of this swing as a pendulum, back and forth. The first swing is strong and pure. The magician is just complete, individual expression of inner will. The magician has all the answers and just wants to impose them on the world.

The High Priestess is the full reverse swing. She is up for learning anything. She's happy to be seated, to work within the structure around her, to read the books, to allow everything to teach her through its complex and unexpected nature."

The patterns emerge. New life is nurtured, gradually and gently guided on its way.

The Empress blends her will with that of the world around her. She cultivates, gardens and protects. 

She is able to see into the future, understanding changes in the seasons, planning ahead and ensuring that the right preparation takes place, but also very capable of enjoying the fruits of her labour.


Look for the way you naturally adapt to change.

Look at how you are cultivating the world around you.

Look for the patterns.

Be aware of the way you limit your actions and step away from potential conflict.

Look to where you are manipulating others to align with your needs.

Observe your desire for luxury.


The Empress is happy to explore, to learn by doing. She emerges as the combination of the magician and the high priestess."

You can see from this how the Empress sits on May Day, the celebration of new life.

The festivals of Lammas and Imbolic are not all that popular these days, so I needed a bit of a reminder. 

Lammas is essentially the celebration of harvest, and Imbolic the first beginnings of spring.

I like the way Death sits on Halloween."
