    "content":"The Fool \n \nThe fool is the first step. A leap into the unknown. Taking action without any awareness of consequences.  \n \nLike a chicken emerging from it's egg, the fool acts without any idea of what lies in store, without any ability to plan or to anticipate.  \n \nThe fool has no fear. The fool is simply open to opportunity, able to step off the cliff and just  assume that things will be fine.   \n \nThe fool allows us to begin. Perhaps with most things in life, if we knew what was actually in store for us, we'd never actually start anything.  \n \n \nTo find the fool:  \n \nLook for new beginnings \nLook for where you feel unbounded, free and light \nLook for actions where there is no thought for consequences, simply the desire to do something. \n \nWhere are things stuck, unable to move on, because there are too many unknowns?  \nWhere are the potential consequences leaving you heavy and uncertain? \nWhere could you just let go and take a leap of faith?  \n \nThe Tarot tells the story of the fool's journey. It is both the starting ignorance and the freedom of enlightenment. It could be that the Tarot is just trying to teach us to be better fools."

    "content":"This Telegram phase of the course has been designed to keep the cards on your mind. Every morning, I’ll share the card of the day and a little write-up.  Your task will be to observe yourself and your world, to see how you can find different aspects of each card reflected in your day. \n\nTelegram will give us the opportunity to share your experience. Use this channel to post text, photos and links that you find align with our card. Don’t worry about being “right or wrong”, you’ll get a feel for it as we go. \n\nSome people may want to jump right in sharing and communicating, but others may just want to observe, both are fine. Sometimes this process can get very busy, and if it gets a bit too much, mute your notifications and dip in when it suits you.  \n\n"

    "content":"The Magician\n\nThings are always easier when you have fresh eyes. The Magician embodies the \"magic\" of beginner's luck. The Magician can walk into a situation, and, without any awareness or  knowledge of the details and the backstory, simply cut through all the crap and get things done.  \n \nThe magician has a childlike clarity of will. He's just pure will perhaps, without any encumbering baggage. The magician can see the end goal and move in a straight line to achieve it.  \n \nMost of us can think of a situation  where we've been plugging away trying to solve a problem for ages, when someone else can just walk in and do it without thinking.  \n \nThat's the magician. It's not really conscious skill, the magic is often little more than sleight of hand, because it only deals with the surface, but often that is enough.  \n \nTo find the magician:  \n \nLook for your ability to just make things happen, to act with a clear end goal.  \nLook for environments where you can see simply solutions that everyone else overlooks \nWatch how you can sometimes get to your destination, but have no recollection of how you got there.  \n \nWhere do you find yourself constantly failing to get the results you got the first time? \nWhere are you not really understanding why people are thinking or acting the way they are? \nWhere are you getting tripped up by details you didn't see.  \n \nThe Magician is a young boy who sees the world in black and white, in simple shapes with clear and obvious ways to succeed."

    "content":"The High Priestess \n \nThe beautiful, mystical potential  of complexity. The interconnections between everything. The amazing hidden depths of life and living.  \n \nThe high Priestess sits calmly between the pillars of conscious and subconscious. She can perceive the inner and outer worlds. She can see through the simple veil and out into the deep, lifegiving sea behind.  \n \nShe is the bubbling, youthful female energy, seeking and inspired by beauty, love, life and relationships. She does not want to dell on the surface, she dives into the passion and complexity of life.  \n \nThe High Priestess is not really all that interested in the goal, instead she wants to experience every moment of the journey.  \n \nTo see the High Priestess:  \n \nFind your excitement for learning new things? \nWatch for times when you're simply open to what is present and not seeking to change anything \nLook for the places where you are needing to go deeper, to understand subtlety \n \nWhere do things feel too complex to understand? \nWhere do you find your knowledge of just how complex and interconnected things are leaves you feeling helpless? \nWhere do you feel overwhelmed by just how much there is to process? \n \nThe high priestess is an expression of abundance. She can see the potential in everything. She flows with the changes all around her."

    "content":"There are many patterns to watch for in the cards. The swing from Yang to Yin, from expressive to receptive, is the most basic.\n\nYou can think of this swing as a pendulum, back and forth. The first swing is strong and pure. The magician is just complete, individual expression of inner will. The magician has all the answers and just wants to impose them on the world.\n\nThe High Priestess is the full reverse swing. She is up for learning anything. She's happy to be seated, to work within the structure around her, to read the books, to allow everything to teach her through its complex and unexpected nature."
